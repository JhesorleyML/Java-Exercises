  Input number: 35
  Expected Output:
  35 is positive

2. Write a Java program to get a number from the user and print whether the number is divisible by 3 or not.
  Test Data
  Input number: 33
  Expected Output:
  33 is divisible by 3

3. Write a Java program that takes three numbers from the user and prints the greatest number.

4. Write a Java program that takes a given year from the user and prints whether that year is a leap year or not
  Test Data
  Input year: 2024
  Expected Output: 
  2024 is a leap year.

5. Write a Java program that requires the user to enter a single character from the alphabet. Print Vowel or Consonant, depending on user input. If the user input is not a letter (between a and z or A and Z), or is a string of length > 1, print an error message.
  Test Data
  Input an alphabet: p
  Expected Output :
  Input letter is Consonant

6. Write a Java Program that creates a multiplication table based on a given range typed by the user

  4  8  12 16 20 24
  5  10 15 20 25 30

7. Create a Java program that asks a user for any number. If 0 is entered, the program will stop asking the user and print the sum of all numbers entered before it terminates. Provide an error statement if a non-number character is entered; however, this should not terminate the program
   Test Data
   Enter a number: 8
   Enter a number: 10
   Enter a number: 5
   Enter a number: j
   Error: invalid number!
   Enter a number: 1
   Enter a number 0
